## Introduction

Welcome to Project 3! ðŸ‘‹

This project contains no new material. Rather, it's a good opportunity to sharpen your understanding of the core concepts of the first half of the course. It'll also give you practice with creating visualizations and websites, and will give you something concrete to put on your resume and show to potential employers!

### Univariate Analysis

<iframe src="assets/histplot.html" width=700 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>
The above graph depicts the distribution of the values of 'total fat' for every recipe in the dataset. Visually, it follows that a large majority of data within the dataset are on recipes with low calorie values. 

### Bivariate Analysis

<iframe src="assets/scatter.html" width=700 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>
The above graph depicts association between 'rating' and 'calories'. Looking at the data, we can infer based off of outlier points that recipes with calorie value higher than average are corelated with higher rating.
