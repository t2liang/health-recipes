## Introduction

In recent years, media and health professionals have promoted a shift to healthier foods, with lower carbs, lower fat, lower sugar, etc. with an emphasis on homecooked meals so as to have more transparency on what we're consuming. An easy way to learn to make homecooked meals is through online recipes. But how do people rate these healthier recipes in comparison to their other recipes? 
To answer this question, we use data coming directly from food.com, containing a dataset of recipes (83782 rows) and a dataset of user ratings (234429 rows) on those recipes. Specifically for the purposes of answering our question, we look at the "rating" column, which contains each user's inputted rating from 1.0 to 5.0, and "tags" column, which contains a list of Food.com's labels that are relevant to each recipe.

* replaced ratings of 0.0 with NAN
* separated each value in 'nutrition' into its own column : 
'calories',
 'total fat',
 'sugar',
 'sodium',
 'protein',
 'saturated fat',
 'carbohydrates'
 * converted values in the nutritional columns to float values in order to compute group means in later permutation tests. 
 * created a "healthy" boolean column containing if each recipe was tagged "healthy" 

### Univariate Analysis

<iframe src="assets/histplot2.html" width=700 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>
The above graph depicts the distribution of the values of 'total fat' for every recipe in the dataset. Visually, it follows that a large majority of data within the dataset are on recipes with low calorie values. 

### Bivariate Analysis

<iframe src="assets/scatter2.html" width=700 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>
The above graph depicts association between 'rating' and 'calories'. Looking at the data, we can infer based off of outlier points that recipes with calorie value higher than average are corelated with higher rating.

### Interesting Aggregates

| healthy   |     1.0 |     2.0 |     3.0 |     4.0 |     5.0 |
|:----------|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
| False     | 43.2865 | 38.5983 | 36.5854 | 34.6861 | 36.5394 |
| True      | 12.6695 | 12.094  | 12.1776 | 12.7224 | 12.579  |

The above table uses the 'healthy' column as its index, 'rating' as its columns, and 'total fat' as its values. Visually, the table conveys that the recipes with the 'healthy' tag indeed contains significantly less fat content than those without the tag.


## Assessment of Missingness

### NMAR Analysis

Within the dataset, the "review" feature is likely to be NMAR. Each "review" data feature within our population represents a self-reported submission by users of the site. "Rating" and "Review" are the only features that are dependent on the input of the user, and not data provided from the recipe site itself. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that a missing review suggests a user choosing not to write a written review or some other means occured that omitted the user's review. In other words, the missingness of the review value depends on the value itself. 

### Missingness Dependency

<iframe src="assets/missing_minutes.html" width=700 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>
The missingness of the "description" column is NOT dependent on the "minutes" column. Our permutation test calculated a p-value of 0.426, and using a significance level of 0.05, we can determine that the "description" column is MCAR on the minutes column.


<iframe src="assets/missing_rating.html" width=700 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>
The missingness of the "description" column IS dependent on the "rating" column.
Our permutation test calculated a p-value of 0.016, and using a significance level of 0.05, we can determine that the "description" column is MAR on the rating column.

## Hypothesis Testing
* Null Hypothesis: In the population, the average rating of recipes labeled “healthy” and  recipes not labeled “healthy” have the same distribution – the lower average rating of recipes with the “healthy” tag is due to chance alone.

We compare two samples:
    - Average rating of “healthy” recipes
    - Average rating of non “healthy” recipes


* Alternative Hypothesis: In the population, recipes labeled “healthy” have a lower average rating than recipes not labeled “healthy” – the lower average rating of recipes with the “healthy” tag is not due to chance alone.
* Test Statistic: mean average rating.

Using a permutation test, we depicted a p-value of 0.0, telling us that there is a near impossible chance for us to witness a difference greater than or equal to the one we observed between the average rating of “healthy” recipes and non “healthy” recipes. Thus, we can reject the null hypothesis with a significance level of 0.05 in favor of the alternative that "healthy" recipes on average are rated lower than those without the "healthy" tag.
